How to Run
----------

1. Start a server by running 

        ./start-server.(bat|sh)
        
2. Connect the client to the server by running 

        ./start-client.(bat|sh)

Notes
-----

* No explicit activation step is required in this example as the server activates itself using the license
* The startup script uses several default values, which may not work for you. For example, the default server ports may
be busy on your system. In that case, you can change the defaults to use explicit values instead.
